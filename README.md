# Personal Project 1: Image Translator

This is a web application, that recognizes object in picture and translates that object's name into another language. 

Paste the URL of your picture, select desired language (93 supported languages), and voil√†! 

Result consist of: recognized object's location in picture also it's title in selected and english languages. You can also check search history by opening navigation menu on the right side of the screen.


* For image recognition I use [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision)
* For translations I use [Yandex Translate API](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/)

Due to security reasons live demo is unavailable at the moment . :disappointed:
